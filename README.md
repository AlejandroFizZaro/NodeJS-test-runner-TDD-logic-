# NodeJS-test-runner-TDD-logic-
As Node was updated with version 20, the test runner was stated as stable, so I tried a few lines of code. 

How to activate the test runner --> Go to Node.js official page and search the test runner site

As this module for Node is new for me, I tried TDD and what I can say is that:

    - Is fully recommended to break the requirement into measurable tests and reduce complexity.
    
    - In this code, you can see that I have stated variables, function arrows... I have typed
      them after the tests are clearly defined. 
      In addition, my code is inside the test curly braces. I did it for the sake of this practice.
      The best practice is to export the values or methods from other file/s to speed up the process
      in production enviroments.
    
    - As for starters this may be harder to implement ( because ( CODE > TEST ) instead of 
      ( TEST > CODE ) may be tempting )  ,TDD + TESTING can reduce time loss or risk of
      bugs in your code and might be fun, it´s like a puzzle game if you get used to!
      
    - As of Version 20 from node, test coverages doesn´t work as expected in Jest and the 
      documentation is not sufficient but, in any case, it´s good to try new ways of coding
      and this module maybe it become more robust in the future and the Jest dependency is 
      not needed. Legacy solutions are used to replace dependencies.
